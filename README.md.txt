Business goal: MVP music reccomender

Recommending songs (not only bands) on users music taste:
Big data solution. Once the data is collected, songs that are similar are clustered to each other. The idea is that if a user inputs a song from one group, the mvp will prioritize giving them recommendations of songs from that same group.

-If in chart > Search for another chart songs
-If not in chart > Search for songs that are actually similar to the ones they picked from an acoustic point of view.
